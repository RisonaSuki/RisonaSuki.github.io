I am a fourth year undergraduate student from [Department of Computer Science](https://computing.hit.edu.cn), [HIT](https://www.hit.edu.cn/).

Research Interest
======
I am focusing on Reinforcement Learning and Deep Learning in solving reality problems, such as LLMs in Robotics and Text-To-Image generation model.

My Goals
======
My goal is to apply AI in ways that truly transform human lifestyles—using robots to replace low-level repetitive tasks, and leveraging models to provide humans with more advanced and effective tools.

Nowadays, AI is developing rapidly, especially in the field of large language models (LLMs). We can use it to accomplish many incredible tasks, such as coding or writing.

However, no matter how advanced LLMs become, they still require human creativity to fully harness their potential. When using LLMs for coding, we need to have a clear structure in mind, or else they may produce confusing or even incorrect responses.

In broader applications, it’s humans who bring AI's knowledge to life. Your SOTA model may perform exceptionally on a computer, but it will never walk into your room and help you clean your dormitory while this task is much easier than generating a picture from words.

To truly liberate humans from direct interaction with AI, we need an agent. Robots are the perfect agents for this role assisting us git rid of those simple and boring works.

If an AI requires human involvement, it means its functionality demands higher-level human thinking, such as understanding art or expressing one's own thoughts. A typical example is generating images from text. Humans always seek to visualize their imagination, and it seems easier to tell an AI what you want to draw than to learn to paint from scratch.

This is precisely why I am interested in both of Robotics and Text-To-Image generation model.
